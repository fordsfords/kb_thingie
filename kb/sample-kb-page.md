## Introduction

This page has some examples of things you might want to use in your KB pages.

Here's an image:

![Whirlpool](whirlpool.png)

But you can't re-size it. To resize you have to use HTML:

<img src="../whirlpool.jpg" width="106" height="74" alt="Whirlpool"/>

Bullet list:

* [[Home]]

Tables don't look so good because I haven't applied any CSS magic. So, for example, no lines are printed.
| Column 1 | Second Column | 3rd |
| -------- | ------------- | --- |
| foo | foo2 | The third foo |
| bar | | The third bar |
| baz | baz2 |

Code snippets are similarly not as nice as GitHub's rendering (same CSS reason). E.g. no independent scroll bar.

This is a long line of code for your reading enjoyment, assuming you like reading code, which certainly makes sense to me since I love reading code.
